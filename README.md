# Exercise - NasaAPP

In this project we will apply everything we have learnt so far to make the **visual part of the application**. It must be responsive, mobile-first. We will use functional `React` to design the front end.

## Putting it all together to have a MERN APP

At the end we should have an integrated and working MERN app. Deploy in Heroku to test that everything works as we have seen in class.

## Requirements

For this, you must take into account the following considerations, which will be essential for this project: 

- Respect the principles and techniques of what we have learned during the course on HTML5, CSS3/SASS, ES6.
- Frontend: Use FUNCTIONAL react.
- JS: DOM manipulation, asynchrony, promises, fetch/axios, async/await... Use the JS language with the principles used in class.
- The use of any `third party resources` (libraries, npm packages, etc.) that can facilitate development is allowed.
- Version control management with GitHub from the beginning of the project. Main branch, develop and corresponding feature branches.
- Special attention will be paid to a clean, readable, well-documented, correctly versioned and easy to maintain code, as well as to the application of the 'SOLID principles'.
